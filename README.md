  ## What It Is/What It Does
  ### Home Page
  - Includes a brief description of what I do, as well as my contact information
  - There is a "Launch Your Idea" button that, when clicked, opens an email client with an email draft addressed to my business email
 ### About Page
  - Includes a longer description of who I am and what I do, plus my name, title, and contact information
 ### Projects page
  - Includes a "Jump To" section, which allows the user to skip to a specific section or project instead of scrolling
  - Includes sections like "Websites and Web Applications", "Mobile Applications", and "Coming Soon"
    - This allows the user to skip to a particular type of project. For example, if the user is only interested in mobile apps, they can skip to that section
  - Includes the titles of projects within their respective sections. Each project subsection also includes an image carousel with pictures of the project in use.
    - This is followed by a brief description of the project
    - Websites/web applications are followed by a "Click Here to Check It Out" button, which redirects the user to the URL for the project

## The Development Process
### Initial Setup
- I bought my domain after confirming that the name was available
- I modified my DNS settings on Network Solutions so that I could use my domain with GitHub Pages
- I created the GitHub repository and then cloned it in VS Code
- I used GitHub pages to host my website and use my custom domain
### Design
- I began by looking at photos of the planet Jupiter for inspiration in terms of the color scheme. The background of the website is color-matched to the planet Jupiter itself and is a
semi-transparent linear gradient overlayed onto a stock image of space.
- To compliment the warm rusty brown colors used in the background, I chose to have dark blue buttons and headings.
- To stand out against the background, text in the main body of each page is an off-white color with dark blue text shadow.
- I chose Orbitron font for things like buttons and headings, to go with the website's space theme. It helps provide a futuristic spacey feel.
- The font for the main body text is a default serif font.
- I chose to have space puns throughout the app, to give it a more friendly and lighthearted feel. This offsets the big intimidating feeling that 
### Development
- I started with a "template" HTML file. I do this for projects where I'll be making multiple pages with the same features (meta tags, navigation buttons, backgrounds, etc.).
  - When creating a new page, I just copy and paste the code from the template file to avoid wasting time typing the same code over and over. Then, I fill in things like
    the headings, body text, etc.
- Next, I created a Styles.css file. I do this for projects where most of the features will be the same across each page. This file handles styles for things like buttons,
  the footer, the background, etc.
- Next, I created HTML and CSS files for each page. The page-specific CSS files are for page-specific features. For example, the placement of images on a specific page
  may be different from the image placement on a different page. Having a Styles.css file in addition to page-specific CSS files allows me to keep my code more organized
  since I know that all of the code in the page-specific CSS files applies to each respective page only. It saves me a lot of scrolling and confusion.
- I created a JavaScript file for the Projects file. This handles the image carousels.

## Other Developments and Future Changes
### Other Developments
- I modified some of my older projects to look nicer. Some of my older projects, from when I was first learning web development, weren't very interesting to look at, so I applied
  my knowledge from college and from working on other projects to create a more visually interesting experience. For example, the Grocery List Maker used to have a flat olive green 
  background, but now includes a stock photo of a grocery store produce section instead. The Variable Income Calculator used to have a blue gradient background, but now includes an image
  of currency and a calculator on a tabletop, underneath a semi-transparent green-to-beige linear gradient. I also made the div elements more interesting, opting for a beige gradient on the
  Grocery List maker and a green radial gradient over an image of a currency pattern on the Variable Income Calculator.
### Future Changes
-  The About Page will include credentials in the future, such as my bachelor's degree and responsive web design certification
-  The "Jump To" section on the Projects Page will be fixed to the top of the page so that the user can jump to anywhere from anywhere without having to scroll back to the top of the page
-  The mobile app projects will be made more visually interesting, just like the web applications
