                This is a website that I developed for a freelance photographer in my area.
                It includes a Home page, an About page, a Gallery page, and a Pricing page. 
                The Gallery page includes two columns with images that this photographer has taken.
                When an image is clicked, it expands so that the user can view it more closely. The "X"
                button can be clicked to return the image to its original size. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The background includes a warm semi-transparent radial gradient overlayed onto an image of film grain. Dark blue 
                semi-transparent buttons compliment the warm background and increase in opacity when hovered over.
                The same shade of dark blue is used for headers and some of the text as well, balancing the warmth of 
                the background with cool accents.

                This is a web application that I developed to make it easier to manage a grocery list while
                maintaining a budget. The user begins by entering a budget amount and clicking "Set Budget" 
                to lock it in. Next, the user enters the grocery items they want on their list, the quantity 
                of each item that they need to buy, and the expected cost of one unit of each item. After entering
                each item, the user can click the "Add" button to add the item to their list. The item will then be 
                displayed in the "Your List" section and the running total will be calculated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When the user clicks
                "Done", the total of their grocery list will be subtracted from their budget amount. The total as well
                as the difference between the total and budget amount will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. Below that
                is a message telling the user whether they're over or under budget, and by how much. The user may click the "Edit"
                button and use the editor to replace or remove items as they wish, until they are satisfied with their grocery list. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It includes a semi-transparent cool brown gradient over a paper texture. The buttons are a chocolate brown color, which seemed
                fitting for the theme of groceries and food. The background includes an image of a produce section, featuring fresh green vegetables.
                This, again, goes with the grocery theme in addition to keeping the user in a food-centric mindset to aid them in the list making process.

                This is a web application that I developed for those who have a variable income rather than salary. This is useful, for example, for 
                those who work hourly, those who do freelance work, those who do odd jobs, etc. To start, the user selects a radio button for how often they 
                get paid. Next, they can enter the values of as many paychecks as they want. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The more paychecks they can enter and the more recent the paychecks are, 
                the more helpful the calculations will be. After clicking "Calculate", the calculations are displayed. This includes the average of all values
                entered, the user's average daily wages, weekly wages, bi-weekly wages, monthly wages, and annual wages. All of these numbers are based off of 
                how often the user gets paid and the numbers entered previously. The highest and lowest paychecks are also displayed at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The calculations provided by this web application are not a definitive prediction for how much money the user will make in the future, however,
                it allows the user to see these calculations based on their past income and make more educated financial decisions based on a larger picture of what
                their income has looked like in the past. It also saves the user time by removing the need for a calculator and notebook to perform these calculations.
                All the user has to do is have their most recent paycheck amounts on hand (or at least some rough estimates), enter them into the application, and let 
                it do the work!

                This is an application that I made as a project for my first mobile app development
                course in college. First, the user enters the names and quantities of each ingredient 
                in their recipe, clicking the "Add" button after each item. Each time the "Add" button 
                is clicked, the ingredients are displayed in a list at the bottom of the screen. Once the
                user is finished entering ingredients, they click the "Done" button.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, the app asks the user if they're multiplying or dividing the recipe, and by how much. 
                Once the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the app either multiplies or divides the original 
                quantities of each ingredient, based on the user's specifications. After that, the app displays 
                a list with the new quantities of each ingredient.
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows the user to quickly and easily multiply or divide a recipe. Whether they're baking 100 
                cupcakes with a recipe that yields 15, or they're cooking for just two people with a recipe that yields
                6 servings, this app can perform the necessary calculations to save the user time.

                This is a mobile app that I am in the process of developing for Critter McCool, a notorious
                person within the pest control community. It allows the user to request an appointment with Critter McCool
                by entering information such as the type of stinging insect, the duration of the problem, their contact information, 
                and the address where the pest control issue is occurring. Next, the user can choose a time of day and how soon they 
                would prefer their appointment to be. Formatting the appointment requests this way allows Critter McCool more flexibility
                in his appointment scheduling, in addition to avoiding disappointment for the customer, since they're not choosing a specific
                time and day to potentially find that it's not available. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the user enters all of the necessary information, they are asked to confirm that all of their information looks correct. If so,
                a message is displayed, stating that they will be contacted ASAP to finalize the details of their appointment. Critter McCool can access
                the appointment requests via the "Admin" button on the home page. This takes him to a login page and, after entering his credentials, he is 
                taken to a page that displays all of his appointment requests and gives him the option to delete them as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows customers to quickly and easily request an appointment with Critter McCool, and allows Critter McCool to easily
                manage his appointment requests at the click of a button. It features a soft yellow background with brown text and buttons, 
                a color scheme that is reminiscent of bees and their hive. The application also includes multiple photos of Critter McCool at 
                previous job sites, providing pleasing visuals and proof that he can get the job done. The home page also includes his contact
                information, incase the customer prefers to contact him directly or has questions about their appointment request.
